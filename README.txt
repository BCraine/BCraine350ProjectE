In project E, I was able to finish steps 1,2,3,4, and 6 with partial completion of steps 5 and 7. Everything compiles correctly with what I have done. For step 5, I struggled getting number.c and letter.c to compile without errors. For part 7, I got the waiting commands in kernel.c but didn't have time to work on shell.c. Since I couldn't figure out why number and letter wouldn't compile, testing my work was kind of a shot in the dark.
