Project D took a lot of thinking on my end but I managed to get all the parts completed code wise. Testing if a majority of my shell works wasn't too successful as I have probably messed up something earlier on in it. I needed a few extra days to complete this project because it required a lot of shell code in addition to project C being extended. Everything compiles without any errors when ./compileOS is run. However, like I mentioned earlier, I struggled with verifying if a majority of the shell commands work.
